                During extended outages, stay updated through AlertShip for restoration estimates. Keep flashlights and batteries handy, avoid opening refrigerators unnecessarily, and check on elderly neighbors. For water outages, store clean water and avoid using electrical appliances when power returns until you're sure the supply is stable.
